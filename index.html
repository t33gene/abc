So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked.
 
A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, "What do you want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?"
 
"We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us," answered Dorothy; "and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you for the world."
 
"Is he tame?" asked the woman, opening the door a little wider. "Oh, yes," said the girl, "and he is a great coward, too. He will be more afraid of you than you are of him."
 
"Well," said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep at the Lion, "if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you some supper and a place to sleep."
 
So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the couch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:
 
"Where are you all going?"
 
"To the Emerald City," said Dorothy, "to see the Great Oz."
